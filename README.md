# Roomie

### Description
Roomie was made in Android Studios using the Kotlin language to provide UW-Eau Claire students with a modern fast way of finding roommates. Using an in app database idea, Roomie stores new users and their profile, as well as their roommate preferences. Roomie provides a matching algorithm that finds which users match your roommate preferences by 62.5%. The user may go through the provided matches and accept or decline. If each user accepts the other, they are allowed to message in-app. Roomie does not use any user information outside the app.
